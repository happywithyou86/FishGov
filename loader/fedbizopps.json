H-8 ACCESS AND GENERAL PROTECTION/SECURITY POLICY AND PROCEDURES FOR UNCLEARED NON-CAC ELIGIBLE CONTRACTORS        1. The Contractor shall comply with, and in the instance of contractor/sub-contractor employees, shall ensure compliance with the following instructions when access to the Fort Leonard Wood installation/facilities are required for contract performance.  These local instructions are incorporated in this contract, in order to implement local installation antiterrorism/operations security policies and procedures, and to supplement Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) clause 52.204-9, which, if applicable to this contract, is located in Section I.  In the event of conflict between any portion of this supplement and/or FAR 52.204-9; and any other provision within the SOW, PWS, or specifications; clause 52.204-9 (if listed in Section I) shall take precedence.  In the event of conflict between this supplement and any other provision within the SOW, PWS, or specifications, this supplement shall take precedence.        a. An uncleared contractor is an individual who falls into one of two categories:  (1) CAC-eligible; and (2) Non-CAC eligible.  The Common Access Card (CAC) is the DoD federal personal identity verification credential.  CAC Eligibility is defined in Army Directive 2014-05, dated March 7, 2014.         b. Army Directive 2014-05 provides that all contractor and/or subcontractor personnel who do not possess a CAC, another Federal personal identity verification card, or other authorized DoD identification card and who require unescorted access to Army installations must have a validated need for such access and undergo a vetting process to determine their fitness for access.  Accordingly, non-CAC eligible, uncleared contractor and/or sub-contractor personnel requiring access to the Fort Leonard Wood installation and facilities, to perform under this contract, will submit personal identity information through the Fort Leonard Wood Installation Pass implementation system detailed in subparagraph (1) below.  There is no charge to the Contractor or employees for this pass.  Request for pass must be submitted a minimum of ten working days prior to date access is planned.        (1) The requesting Contractor personnel and sub-contractor's personnel shall submit their requests for installation pass to their sponsor via the web based Fort Leonard Wood Installation     Pass Application IM3500 Secure Webportal, located at the following web link: https://vcc1.icmvcc.com/im3500/.   The minimum information required to complete the pass application at the Fort Leonard Wood Installation Pass Application IM3500 Secure Webportal listed in paragraph b, above, is as follows:  1. Point of Contact Email (Valid sponsor's email address).  A valid sponsor is the COR, COTR, or other Government employee designated in writing by the Contracting Officer (KO) at time of contract award, post award conference, or pre-construction conference; or the KO if no other designation is made.  2. Visitor's email address; 3. ID Number (Visitor's Driver's License Number); 4. ID Jurisdiction (State that issued the visitor driver's license); 5. Visit Start Date (The first date of visitor's visit); 6. Visit End Date (The last date of visitor's visit, not to exceed the length of the contract or one year, whichever is shorter); 7. Visitor's Name (Last name, First name, Middle name & suffix); 8. Phone Number and Address; 9. Date of Birth; 10. Eye Color; 11. Hair Color; 12. Sponsoring Organization and Applicant's Company Name.  Additionally, vehicle information may be required (Vehicle VIN Number, Plate Number, Plate Jurisdiction, Vehicle Year of Manufacture, Vehicle Make, Vehicle Model, Vehicle Color, and Vehicle Type)        (2) The information collected at this website will be used by the government to query, at a minimum, the National Crime Information Center Interstate Identification Index (NCIC-III) and the Terrorist Screening Database (TSDB) to determine if the person requesting unescorted access presents a potential threat to the good order, discipline, or health and safety on the installation.  Army Directive 2014-05, enclosure 2, establishes Army policy for adjudication and screening standards to control the access of unescorted uncleared contractors (contractor and subcontractor personnel) to Army installations and facilities.        (3) Uncleared contractor personnel will, in the absence of an approved waiver, be denied unescorted access to Fort Leonard Wood should the above mentioned checks contain credible derogatory information indicating that the individual may present a threat to the good order, discipline, or health and safety on the installation.  Such derogatory information includes, but is not limited to that provided within Enclosure 2, Army Directive 2014-05 (Policy and Implementation Procedures for Common Access Card Credentialing and Installation Access for Uncleared Contractors), which is available to the public at the following website:  http://www.apd.army.mil/ .        (4) Access Denial Waiver Process.  An explanation of the waiver process for individual denials of access is provided in Army Directive 2014-05.  The denial of unescorted entry onto the military installation of one or several of the contractor's or subcontractor's personnel shall not be considered an excuse for nonperformance of contract requirements.  Nor is the Government responsible for providing escorts for individuals denied unescorted access to the Installation.        c. All contractor and subcontractor personnel performing tasks on this contract shall at all times comply with applicable installation, facility and area commander installation/facility access and local security policies and procedures provided herein and otherwise provided to the Contractor by an authorized Government representative.  Contractors are warned that Installation area access control plans may require increased vigilance and restrictions on access to military installations in the case of heightened Force Protection Condition (FPCON) levels.  If task completion is hampered by temporary Government limitations on access to the Installation, the Contractor and Contracting Officer shall negotiate any extensions on delivery necessitated by emergency situations.  In addition, if heightened security requires the submission of additional security information and/or the implementation of additional security measures the Contractor shall fully cooperate with Government security procedures and requests for information.

    "description": "The DoS is installing BAS systems in New Embassy Compounds (NEC's) around the world. Currently there are 100 NEC's with BAS systems installed by a variety of third party vendors. The implementation of the BAS is providing many challenges for DoS oversight and management; examples of the challenges faced include: varied skillsets among FM's responsible for BAS operations; inconsistent power supplies at embassy compounds; varying skill levels among LES responsible for BAS oversight; limited resources for BAS support; limited vendor availability, responsiveness and support; language barriers impacting the ability to train LES responsible for BAS management; limited protocol for emergency response when BAS systems fail; lack of knowledge on how to modify BAS parameters for new space allocation or other NEC facility modifications; no best practice strategies for troubleshooting BAS problems; lack of a plan/process for upgrading BAS software that is outdated; and minimal knowledge of how manual overrides or modifications of BAS parameters impacts overall facility operations. These are in addition to the challenges related to a lack of basic BAS operational knowledge. The types of systems installed at NEC's involve, at a minimum, seven different BAS vendors as well as an undetermined number of third party contractors responsible for the system installations, support, and knowledge transfer.",

The mission of USTRANSCOM is to provide full-spectrum global mobility solutions and related enabling capabilities for supported customers' requirements in peace and war.  USTRANSCOM has a responsibility to improve the overall efficiency and interoperability of distribution related activities within the Department of Defense.  USTRANSCOM is the contracting activity for surface transportation requirements.\nDescription\nA requirement exists for transportation coordination services to support the United States Government (USG), Department of Defense (DoD), and DoD Contractors supporting DoD missions, such as the Joint Strike Fighter Program.  Services encompass support from receipt of the shipment request through final payment for services rendered.  Support will include management of shipments to ensure required transportation is successfully completed.  Transportation support is required for Freight All Kinds (FAK) shipments including, but not limited to, First Destination Transportation (vendor shipments), Second Destination, Scheduled Routes, DLA Disposition Services (formerly known as DRMS), Unit Moves, Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) support, Humanitarian/Contingency support, Foreign Military Sales (FMS) and surge shipments.  First Destination Transportation shipments currently shipped under other contracts may be supported under this PWS as those contracts end.  Contractor may be required to assist/provide Customs Brokerage support for shipments moved under this contract such as assisting shippers with customs documentation and clearances and identifying customs protocols.\nServices will be provided between various locations within the Continental United States (CONUS), including but not limited to Vendor Facilities, DOD warehouses or consolidation facilities, and US Armed Forces Bases/Camps/Posts.  Pickup and delivery may occasionally be necessary in Alaska and Canada (OCONUS).  Pickup locations may be revised, increased, or decreased dependent on DoD structural changes, alignments, operational tempo, and business process changes.  Routes may include multiple stops and split pickups.\nVarious equipment types will be required to meet mission requirements.  Only single brokering is permitted for Less than Truckload (LTL), Truck Load (TL), and Scheduled trucks (no brokering restriction on air or rail shipments).\n\u00a0\nThe period of performance for this effort includes a two-year base period, three one-year option periods, two one-year award term option periods, and a six-month extension per FAR 52.217-8, Option to Extend Services.Base Year 1:\u00a0 11 September 2015 -\u00a0 10 September 2016Base Year 2:\u00a0 11 September 2016 \u2013 10 September 2017Option Year 1:\u00a0 11 September 2017 \u2013 10 September 2018Option Year 2:\u00a0 11 September 2018 \u2013 10 September 2019Option Year 3:\u00a0 11 September 2019 \u2013 10 September 2020Award Term Option Year 1:\u00a0 11 September 2020 \u2013 10 September 2021Award Term Option Year 2:\u00a0 11 September 2021 \u2013 10 September 202252.217-8 Option to Extend Services:\u00a0 11 September 2022 \u2013 10 March 2023\nAt contract start, the services identified above are required to support the Defense Logistics Agency (DLA) and the Defense Contract Management Agency (DCMA).   Other government agencies may require these services over the course of the contract.\nThe North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code for this requirement is anticipated to be NAICS 488510, Freight Transportation Arrangement.  The acquisition strategy of this requirement has yet to be determined.\nThe solicitation for this acquisition will be released electronically and will be available only on the Federal Business Opportunities (FedBixOpps) website at www.fbo.gov.

This factor will be rated on an Acceptable/Unacceptable basis.  If Corporate Experience is determined unacceptable, the evaluation of the proposal will cease and no other factors or subfactors will be evaluated. As a result of adding this factor, RFP Attachment 11, Corporate Experience Table has been added.\nThe relative order of importance for evaluation has been revised to state that Technical Capability is now more important than Past Performance.  It remains that all rated evaluation factors (Technical Capability and Past Performance), when combined, are approximately equal to price.  Price is evaluated but is not rated.\nAll offerors are requested to provide a Quality Assurance Surveillance Plan (QASP) under Technical Capability, Subfactor 4 - Operational Support.\nThe Pricing Rate Table, RFP Attachment 2 has been revised to provide offerors an opportunity to decrement the estimated Global Insight Index (GII) that will be applied to the second base year, three one-year options, and two one-year award terms to determine the total evaluated price.  Instructions were revised to better explain how to submit pricing and corrections were made to address all errors in calculations found throughout the document.  Further, the Scheduled Truck Tab, 2B5 - Scheduled Lanes was revised to better capture pricing for applicable requirements in accordance with PWS Appendix I, Scheduled Truck Routes.

    "description": "This notice is for market research and planning purpose only and does not obligate the Government to any contractual agreement. This is not a request for proposal. The Government does not intend to award a contract on the basis of responses, nor otherwise pay for the preparation of any information submitted, nor will respondents be notified of the review of the information received. The information obtained from this Request for Information (RFI) will be utilized as market research for consideration in development of the Acquisition Strategy and Acquisition Plan for this requirement. The Government will not reimburse interested sources for any costs incurred in preparation of a response to this notice. Information provided herein is subject to change and in no way binds the Government to solicit for or award a contract.\nThe purpose of this Request for Information is to determine the companies capable of performing the effort described herein.\n1. BACKGROUND:\nThe mission of the International Trade Administration (ITA) of the Department of Commerce is to strengthen the competitiveness of U.S. industry, promote trade and investment, and ensure fair trade through the rigorous enforcement of U.S. trade laws and agreements. Global Markets (GM) is one of three business units within ITA that promotes this mission. GM promotes U.S. exports, particularly those of small- and medium-sized enterprises, and protects United States commercial interests abroad through market access case work.\nGM operates a network of offices in 108 domestic locations and in more than 120 cities in 79 markets. Overseas offices are staffed by 245 Foreign Service Officers (approximately 40 officers also serve in domestic assignments) and approximately 960 locally hired employees. Domestic offices are staffed by 322 trade specialists, Foreign Service officers on domestic tours, and support staff. GM uses a \"Domestic Resource Allocation Model\" (DRAM) and an \"Overseas Resource Allocation Model\" (ORAM) to guide decision-making about domestic and international employee allocation. The DRAM includes small and medium-sized (SME) enterprise counts weighted by factors derived from Industry Export Intensiveness data at the Metropolitan Statistical Area (MSA) and County levels, as well as forecasts for growth in SME counts. The ORAM model includes economic/commercial data related to market potential for U.S. exports and to GM's mission, and produces a ranking of countries, with higher-ranked countries warranting more staff than lower-ranked countries. The data are used by GM's senior management in making informed resource allocation decisions. The model relies upon current (as of the time of contract award) economic data, although the existing data can be used as a template to guide the construction/validation of the new model. The DRAM model includes data informing the export intensiveness of key industry sectors, and the counts of SMEs by sectors at the MSA and County levels. Both models are reviewed and vetted internally by ITA's Industry & Analysis (I&A) unit, which is the unit within ITA that provides data, analysis, and recommendations on policy and promotion issues affecting U.S. industry competitiveness in a global setting to maximize U.S. gains in trade negotiations.\n2. DESCRIPTION/:\nGM is seeking Contractor support services to update its ORAM and DRAM. Both models were last updated in December 2014. The duration of this contract is five (5) years; this will include a base year and four (4) option years.\n- The Contractor shall propose, develop, and implement a methodology to revalidate and update the DRAM, ORAM, and Industry Export Intensiveness data. \u2018Validate' means that the model is accurate and reliable in serving its intended purpose. Factors determining reliability and accuracy include application of variables directly relevant to GM's mission, using best available data sources, eliminating extraneous or redundant variables, and assessing implications of variances. The purpose of the models is to provide an objective reference point and an aid for GM decision making for the allocation of domestic and overseas resources based on the best potential for U.S. exporters.\n- The Contractor shall have the personnel and resources to provide efficient and cost-effective support services to revalidate, revise accordingly, and update the Domestic Resource Allocation Model, Overseas Resource Allocation Model, and the Industry Export Intensiveness data.\n- The Contractor shall develop and implement a methodology to revalidate, revise, and update the DRAM. \u2018Validate' means that the model is accurate and reliable from the standpoint of serving its intended purpose. Factors affecting accuracy and reliability to be included in the model: - Variables directly relevant to GM's mission and resource allocation decisions- Use of best available data sources- Elimination of extraneous or redundant variables- Comparison of current resource allocation practices to model-suggested allocation to assess implications of variances.\n- Among the activities the Contractor shall include in development of the models: - Meet with Industry & Analysis (I&A) officials conducting economic/commercial analyses in support of NEI (National Export Initiative) Next (e.g., to identify top country/export sector combinations) to consider whether/how these analytic approaches should be incorporated into the DRAM and the ORAM. - Identify variables that could be dropped (based on redundancy or for other reasons).- Consider variables that could supersede existing data streams as more reliable, more comprehensive, or better indicators of what the variable signifies.- Consider new variables based on availability of new data streams directly relevant to the model's purpose or consider a new analytic approach if merited based on the model review process.- Consider incorporating add-factors to the model that are based on Administration priorities, if relevant to the model's purpose and aligned with GM's central resource allocation strategy.- Perform sensitivity analysis. For example, check model results for consistency across countries, and alter weights (\"shock\" the model) within data categories to determine whether this affects the overall tier in which a country is ranked. - Cross-check model-suggested allocation with current staff allocation and assess implications of anomalies.- Provide documentation for data selection/elimination and citations for data sources.- For the DRAM, ensure that data at the MSA and county levels on SME counts by sector is included. Propose a means to map those data with ITA-defined industry sectors in the assignment of both Sector leaders positions and the proper assignment of industry sector responsibilities to client-facing personnel.- Design and document the model such that ITA technical staff can conduct routine updates and make modifications in the future. Meet with ITA technical staff prior to finalizing documentation to answer questions and ensure documentation answers questions raised.\n3. INSTRUCTIONS\nThis is a REQUEST FOR INFORMATION.
