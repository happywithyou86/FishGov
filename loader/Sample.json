As part of this CM procurement the GSA will require a wide range of management, construction, inspection and other professional services necessary to ensure the quality of work and the success of Phase 2.  The CM will be required to maintain a team with the expertise and capability to manage/coordinate the timely and orderly development of the design and construction of the project (including coverage for after hours/weekend work as needed).  Given the size, complexity, uniqueness, and overall importance both politically and locally of the project, the CM must have the capability and experience to meet all of the GSA's requirements.\nPROJECT DESCRIPTIONThe San Ysidro Land Port of Entry (LPOE) is the busiest land port in the world.  The 30-year-old outdated facility can no longer support nor enforce the missions of the U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP).  The LPOE processes approximately an average of 50,000 northbound vehicles and 25,000 northbound pedestrians per day.  The San Diego Association of Governments (SANDAG) predicts an increase in vehicle traffic at San Ysidro of up to 70% by the year 2030.  SANDAG's studies indicate a substantial economic impact of roughly $8.4 billion in lost revenue to the region resulting from increased wait times at the border. Given the delays at current traffic volumes, capacity of the LPOE must be increased to accommodate regional growth.\nTo address these growing concerns the LPOE is undergoing a three (3) phase Expansion & Reconfiguration Project estimated to cost over $500M.  Under this procurement the Construction Management (CM) will be required to provide the necessary services to support the successful design and construction of only Phase 2 of the overall project.  It is however anticipated that the Phase 2 construction will be ongoing simultaneously with other projects at the Port, including but not limited to Phase 3, West Pedestrian Building, and Virginia Avenue Transit Center.  Phase 2 contains, but is not limited to, the following primary construction project elements:•\tDemolition of the existing Northbound Pedestrian Processing/Detention building, the existing central plant, multiple buildings on East San Ysidro Blvd (specifically those known as the Payless, Milo, and old Greyhound Buildings), and a portion of East San Ysidro Blvd south of the MTS trolley.\n•\tConstruction of a new northbound Pedestrian Processing/Administration/Detention Center Building, a northbound pedestrian pathway and its associated canopy structure from the Mexico border to the new pedestrian processing building, two (2) overhead Employee Pedestrian Bridges, an electrical generator yard, and a Pedestrian Plaza.\n•\tRenovation of the existing Historic Custom House building to provide a new Pedestrian Processing operation.  Note that the renovation will require consultation with the State Historic Preservation Office (SHPO) and adherence to the National Historic Preservation Act (NHPA) Section 106 process.\nACQUISITION STRATEGYThe GSA will seek a source utilizing the GSA Schedules Program under schedule 871-7 Construction Management & Engineering Consulting Services Related to Real Property and in accordance with Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) Part 8.4 Federal Supply Schedules.  A Request for Proposal (RFP) will be prepared by the GSA and will follow the procedures outlined in FAR 8.405-2(c)(3) for proposed orders exceeding the simplified acquisition threshold.  This procurement opportunity will be open to all qualified firms under this schedule who meet the GSA's requirements identified in the RFP.  This is a competitive source selection using the best-value trade-off process to award a firm fixed price Task Order.\nThe current schedule anticipates a Task Order award in August 2015, however that is subject to change should the GSA deem necessary.\nSUBMISSION REQUIREMENTSThe Request for Proposal (RFP) will be issued electronically on or about Monday April 27, 2015 via the FedBizOpps website attached to this posting.  Although it is not mandatory, interested parties are encouraged to affix their names to the Interested Vendors Listing in order to receive notifications. Issuance of this notice does not warrant that funds are presently available for award of a Task Order.  Award of the Task Order shall be subject to the availability of appropriated funds, and the Government shall incur no obligation under this notice in advance of such time as funds are made available to the Contracting Officer for the purpose of award.\nPlease continue to check back to receive the most updated information.\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\tAdded: Apr 27, 2015 8:20 pm\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\tANNOUNCEMENT - MONDAY APRIL 27, 2015\nAs previously indicated the GSA issues The Solicitation: Request for Proposal (RFP) for the referenced project.

The Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS), Program Support Center (PSC), Acquisition Management Services (AMS), on behalf of the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration (SAMHSA) intends to sole source to:\nFaces and Voices of Recovery (FAVOR)1010 Vermont AvenueSuite 618Washington, DC 20005-4941\nOrganizations made up of individuals with lived experience, called Recovery Community Organizations (RCOs), are becoming and will continue to emerge as major players in the behavioral health delivery system. SAMHSA recognizes the need to ensure that RCOs are fully equipped to expand the behavioral health workforce and to meet the needs of those being served with high-quality services. A key strategy for ensuring the quality of peer services is to accredit RCOs that provide peer recovery support services.\nSAMHSA is seeking to support the expansion of Peer Recovery Support Services (PRSS) as a key component of the continuum of care for people seeking, stabilizing, and sustaining recovery from addiction to alcohol and other drugs. In this effort, SAMHSA is seeking to promote a commitment to quality assurance and integrity of peer recovery community services and recovery community organizations that provide PRSS. Through this acquisition, SAMHSA seeks to share information with recovery community organizations and allied behavioral health treatment and recovery concerning the effectiveness of peer recovery support services through standards and measures; components of quality and ethical peer practice; increase access to high quality recovery supports within communities; and to advance peer services as a component of health care delivery through a specialized recovery community organization accreditation framework.\nFaces and Voices of Recovery (FAVOR) is the primary organization committed to organizing and mobilizing the over 23 millions of Americans in recovery from addiction to alcohol and other drugs, their families, friends, and allies to advocate for the addiction recovery community. FAVOR has been the sole organization to establish a network of recovery community organizations. In 2011, FAVOR hosted a consultation meeting with recovery community organization representatives to explore the possibility of establishing an accreditation system for organizations and programs providing with peer recovery support services. The group showed congruent thinking and fundamental agreement on the need for a process of accreditation and the development of standards focusing on PRSS. Since that time, FAVOR has developed a set of core domains in the effective delivery of PRSS, and has field tested an accreditation process in six recovery community organizations. SAMHSA is recommending FAVOR as a sole source for the work outlined to continue the readiness for the accreditation of recovery community organizations and those that provide peer recovery supports services to those individuals and their families in or seeking recovery from addiction to alcohol and other drugs. As indicated, FAVOR has established an accreditation process specifically for recovery community organizations and is the only organization that has developed and initiated an accreditation process and accompanying technical assistance for addiction peer recovery organizations.\nDescription of Tasks:\nTask 1 and 2 - Conference Call/Work Plan\nFourteen (14) days after receipt of order, FAVOR shall participate in a conference call meeting with the Contracting Officer's Representative (COR) to discuss the requirements and deliverables of the task order. Within one (1) month of the conference call, FAVOR shall produce a brief (e.g., 3-5 pages) work plan outlining key activities and action steps to successfully accomplish the tasks below. The Work Plan will describe the key tasks to be conducted, an implementation time table and describe how key tasks will be coordinated.\nTask 3 - Develop Accreditation Readiness Tools\nFAVOR shall develop at least three (3) accreditation readiness on-line tools. These tools shall be developed in concert with a review of the consistent areas that were identified as \"needing improvement\" in the 2014 round of accreditations and upon completions of a survey of other existing readiness tools. The tools shall be brief, clear and easy to understand. The tools shall be used as a means for self-assessment for Recovery Community Organizations (RCOs) to determine their level of readiness for accreditation and to assist in preparing for the accreditation process. Draft versions of the tools shall be provided to the COR within 75 days of award. Final versions shall be provided within 45 days of COR comments/revisions.Task 4 - Revise Core Standards\nFAVOR shall revise core standards used in the RCO accreditation process based on findings from the 2014 accreditation process with RCOs. One DRAFT revision of the core standards shall be submitted to the COR within 90 days after receipt of order (ARO). A FINAL version of the core standards will be provided to the COR within 120 days after receipt of order (ARO).\nTask 5 - Develop Standards in Optional Domains\nFAVOR shall develop at least two additional optional performance-based domains: (1) Telephone and New Media Support, (2) PRSS Training. Other performance-based domains may emerge. Within 60 days after receipt of order (ARO), FAVOR will provide the COR a DRAFT of the (2) optional domain standards and the measures for each. Within 120 days after receipt of order (ARO), FAVOR will present a final version of the standards and their measures.\n Task 6 - Develop a Cloud-Based Standardized Data Collection and Management Tool for PRSS programs\nA cloud-based standardized data collection and management tool that will assist PRSS programs in easy data collection and reporting will be developed. This tool will allow for data collection and management of process, outcome, and impact measures, and will be designed for users who are not specific data experts. It will be easily accessible and customer-friendly. The tool will include the ability to input data, analyze and aggregate data, and will include reports that can be used at the program level for programmatic decisions, process reviews, and marketing of PRSS to funders, systems level organizers, health care systems, etc. The data management tool should be easily modifiable by the owner, so that updates can be made. FAVOR shall deliver a report on the frame of the Data Collection Management tool and its features 90 days after receipt of order (ARO). Within 270 days after receipt of order (ARO), a Cloud-Based Standardized Data Collection and Management Tool for PRSS programs will be delivered to the COR.\nThis is not a solicitation for competitive proposal. No solicitation document is available. All responsible sources that have determined that they can provide the same services may submit product information and a capabilities statement.

This will be a new requirement. It is anticipated that the resultant contract will be a cost-reimbursement type with a period of performance of 60 months (Base Year with four (4) Option Years.) The applicable NAICS code is 621511 with a size standard of $32.5M. The RFP will be posted in FedBizOpps and is expected to be released on or about May 15, 2015. Interested parties are responsible for checking the website regularly for release of the RFP and for other procurement related documents. TELEPHONE CALLS WILL NOT BE ACCEPTED. The information provided in this pre-solicitation notice is for information purposes only. If there are any differences in the information provided here and the actual solicitation when released, the information provided in the actual solicitation shall govern. The CDC/NCHHSTP has a potential requirement to provide tuberculosis (TB) laboratory services to the U.S.-affiliated Pacific Islands (USAPI). TB laboratory services are not readily available in the USAPI, creating a barrier for the CDC to ensure effective TB control and prevention in the region. Quality and timely TB laboratory services will ensure that CDC is able to provide medical consultation and technical assistance to the TB programs. The local public health infrastructure and resources in the USAPI cannot support the TB laboratory needs promulgated by CDC without access to a contract laboratory.The U.S. prevention and control agenda for the CDC/DTBE includes the 50 states, Puerto Rico, U.S. Virgin Islands, and six (6) USAPI jurisdictions. The USAPI include the U.S. Territories of American Samoa, the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands, Guam, and three (3) Freely Associated States (FAS): the Federated States of Micronesia, the Republic of the Marshall Islands, and the Republic of Palau. The FAS have a Compact of Free Association with the United States. Under the compact, these nations are fully sovereign in domestic and foreign affairs, but the U.S. is responsible for their health, education, defense, and other essential operations to the United States.As indicated in the Essential Components of a Tuberculosis Prevention and Control Program, one of the core components for effective TB control programs involves the delivery of laboratory and diagnostic services, as well as the need to collect and analyze data. Through extensive technical assistance and laboratory assessments, CDC has identified that laboratories throughout the USAPI lack the capacity and expertise to fulfill this essential program activity. The following tasks are needed to ensure the delivery of TB laboratory services in the USAPI:1. Establish and implement a logistical plan and protocol to ship TB specimens;2. Identification of Mycobacterium tuberculosis and drug resistance;3. Quality assurance;4. On-site technical assistance site visits;5. Training of USAPI TB laboratory staff;6. Expert laboratory consultation.The offeror shall furnish all the necessary personnel, facilities, supplies, and equipment, as appropriate, to provide CDC with the required scientific, technical, and operational services within the general work parameters set forth in the performance work statement.","location":"Procurement and Grants Office (Atlanta)","posted_date":"April 20, 2015","attachments":[{"title":"RFP_2015-N-17138_Final_05-22-15.pdf","description":"RFP 2015-N-17138","url":"https://www.fbo.gov/utils/view?id=119b60a14c04a6700012143624ac6554"},{"title":"ACH_Vendor_Miscellaneous_Payment_Enrollment_Form_Attachment_J-1.pdf","description":"Attachment J-1_ACH Vendor","url":"https://www.fbo.gov/utils/view?id=381aacc60607fc1829f3a58f04d6b93a"},{"title":"Past_Performance_Survey_Attachment_J-2.pdf","description":"Attachment J-2_Past Performance","url":"https://www.fbo.gov/utils/view?id=3ac0db76c1a30f46af219d9841883a1b"},{"title":"SF-1034_Public_Voucher_for_Purchases_Services_other_than_Personnel_Attachment_J-3.pdf","description":"Attachment J-3_SF1034","url":"https://www.fbo.gov/utils/view?id=da0469bf4561f1b509a92d67a80ab768"},{"title":"SF-1035_Public_Voucher_for_Purchases_Continuation_Sheet_Attachment_J-4.pdf","description":"Attachment J-4_SF1035","url":"https://www.fbo.gov/utils/view?id=aa3b5ad40f1e1201aa17a61b070ed61a"},{"title":"Packaging_and_Delivery_of_Proposal_Attachment_J-5.pdf","description":"Attachment J-5_Packaging","url":"https://www.fbo.gov/utils/view?id=ca290627bf193aba4f49742dfa30cf04"},{"title":"Proposal_Intent_Response_Sheet_Attachment_J-6.pdf","description":"Attachment J-6_Proposal Intent","url":"https://www.fbo.gov/utils/view?id=4d7b701769f2e452996bb666adf037d0"},{"title":"Representations_and_Certifications_Attachment_J-7.pdf","description":"Attachment J-7_Reps & Certs","url":"https://www.fbo.gov/utils/view?id=60ccf2f785b02817d5701bbb25926556"},{"title":"QASP_Attachment_J-8.pdf","description":"Attachment J-8_QASP","url":"https://www.fbo.gov/utils/view?id=df322521c2ed4ec76fa3f2f5eb847ea9"}],"primary_point_of_contact":"Kim H.

The Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) intends to negotiate a one-time sole source contract with Biomatrica Incorporated, 5627 Oberlin Drive, STE 120, San Diego, CA 92121. The Government intends to negotiate with only one source under the authority of FAR 6.302-1.\nThis notice will be distributed solely through the General Services Administration's Federal Business Opportunities (FBO) Website (www.fedbizopps.gov). Interested parties are responsible for monitoring the FBO site to ensure they have the most up-to-date information about this acquisition. The North American Classification System Code is 541711, Research and Development in Biotechnology; the size standard is 500 employees.\nThe Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) intends to award a non-competitive, sole source contract to Biomatrica Incorporated, 5627 Oberlin Drive, STE 120, San Diego, CA 92121 for one 10mL bottles of liquid DNAstable Plus for liquid and liquid-to-dry (LD) storage. Services are being procured under FAR 13.5, Simplified Acquisition Procedures.\nThe Federal Bureau of Investigation Laboratory generates a great amount of DNA extracts that are used for validation studies. As the chemistries change, population databases need to be re-typed and updated to stay concurrent. In order to attain reliable and quality results for these updates, it is important that the samples are well preserved throughout the years.\nThere are two known products available for the purposes of stabilizing and storing DNA for long periods of time - Biomatrica and Gentegra. These two matrices were tested by the FBI DNA Support Unit to determine which, if any, would meet the requirements of the FBI.\nThe testing and validation studies revealed that the Gentegra product was not as efficient as preserving the DNA extracts compared to the Biomatrica DNAStable Plus. Although both products did preserve the samples, as the quantities of DNA were higher (closer to the expected value) on the samples treated with the matrix in comparison to those that were not; the Biomatrica DNAStable Plus provided an even higher quantity especially when dealing with low level samples.\nThe testing and validation studies demonstrated that the Biomatrica DNAStable Plus recovery was 20% higher than that of Gentegra at the three month mark indicating that a greater amount of DNA was lost when using the Gentegra matrix.\nThe Biomatrica DNAStable Plus is the only product that meets the requirements of the FBI and has been verified that it protects the preservation of the DNA and enables these samples to be stored at room temperature storage indefinitely.\nThis notice of intent is not a request for competitive quotations; however, interested parties may identify their interests and capability to respond to this requirement to this office by 08:00 am, EST, May 26, 2015, by email to the attention of Jerry Varnell, Contract Specialist, at Jerry.Varnell@ic.fbi.gov. Information received will be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether or not to conduct a competitive procurement. Telephone requests will not be considered. A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed contract based upon response to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.\nVendors must be registered in SAM, effective July 29, 2012 to receive government contracts. The FBI uses a financial system that has a direct interface with SAM. Please ensure that your company's SAM information is updated and accurate. This includes TIN, EFT, DUNS, addresses and contact information. The EFT banking information on file in SAM will be what the FBI uses to process payment to your organization.","location":"Procurement Section","posted_date":"","attachments":[{"title":"Sole-Source_Justification_-_PR-0022262.pdf","description":"Sole-Source Justification","url":"https://www.fbo.gov/utils/view?id=d02a4acab35655047bd8301c0a3214e3"}],"primary_point_of_contact":"Jerry D.

In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights.\n        (C) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. Sec.  6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment.\n        (D) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. 362 (the Bankruptcy Code).\n  (i) Certification Regarding Knowledge of Child Labor for Listed End Products (Executive Order 13126).\n    (1) Listed end products.\nListed End Product\tListed Countries of Origin\n\n\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\n    (2) Certification.

For manufactured end products, the Buy American Act uses a two-part test to define a domestic end product.(1) The article must be manufactured in the United States; and(2) The cost of domestic components must exceed 50 percent of the cost of all the components. In accordance with 41 U.S.C. 431, this component test of the Buy American Act has been waived for acquisitions of COTS items (see 12.505(a)).(b) The Buy American Act applies to small business set-asides. A manufactured product of a small business concern is a U.S.-made end product, but is not a domestic end product unless it meets the component test in paragraph (a)(2) of this section.(c) Exceptions that allow the purchase of a foreign end product are listed at 25.103. The unreasonable cost exception is implemented through the use of an evaluation factor applied to low foreign offers that are not eligible offers. The evaluation factor is not used to provide a preference for one foreign offer over another. Evaluation procedures and examples are provided in Subpart 25.5.\n52.249-1 TERMINATION FOR CONVENIENCE OF THE GOVERNMENTThe Contracting Officer, by written notice, may terminate this contract, in whole or in part, when it is in the Government's interest.

While these functions are critical to the success of DDTP programs, they are not inherently federal functions.This is a Small Business and AI/AN owned Sources Sought notice. This is NOT a solicitation for proposals, proposal abstracts, or quotations. The purpose of this notice is to obtain information regarding: (1) the availability and capability of qualified small business sources; (2) whether they are small businesses; HUBZone small businesses; service-disabled, veteran-owned small businesses; 8(a) small businesses; veteran-owned small businesses; woman-owned small businesses; or small disadvantaged businesses;(3) AI/AN owned businesses; and (4) their size classification relative to the North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code for the proposed acquisition. Your responses to the information requested will assist the Government in determining the appropriate acquisition method, including whether a set-aside is possible. BACKGROUND:The mission of the Indian Health Service (IHS), Division of Diabetes Treatment and Prevention (DDTP) is to develop, document, and sustain a public health effort to prevent and control diabetes and related chronic diseases in America Indian and Alaska Native (AI/AN) people and communities. The DDTP employs collaborative strategies in the 12 IHS Areas through coordination of a network of Area Diabetes Consultants, and approximately 500 Special Diabetes Program for Indians (SDPI) grant programs. In addition, the DDTP is the primary point of contact for inter-agency as well as intra-agency communication on the prevention and treatment of diabetes and related chronic diseases in AI/AN communities.The SDPI program was initially established and authorized by Congress through the Balanced Budget Act of 1997. It has since been augmented and reauthorized, extending it through 2015. Currently funded at $150 million per year, DDTP has only two permanent professional federal employees to administer all of the SDPI grant programs, including coordinating and implementing the entire competitive grant application process for FY 2016. As a result of this shortage in federal staffing, as well as the necessity of continuing work on this and other mission critical national projects, including the First Lady's \"Let's Move! In Indian Country\" (LMIC) initiative, the DDTP is in need of a cadre of professionals with experience in working with AI/AN communities to provide expertise in biostatistics, medical review, data analysis, communications, medical nutrition therapy, program review and evaluation, federal grants management, web site development and design, project management, and writing and editing.  This contract will support IHS DDTP program activities and initiatives by providing professional expertise and management of the tasks that will be detailed in the scope of work. It will require as many as 20 to 30 specialists that can provide services for varying amounts of time throughout the year. The quality, quantity, and timeliness of performed services will make a significant impact on the DDTP mission and overall program performance and will ultimately affect key stakeholders that include IHS leadership and IHS/Tribal/Urban (I/T/U) healthcare programs nationwide. This contract will be for five periods, a base period and four option periods. The contract type is intended to be a Firm-Fixed price. The Dissemination of Information and Resources tasks are focused on continued development and utilization of the IHS DDTP website as the primary platform for dissemination of information and resources for clinical staff and SDPI grantees. This also includes continued provision of virtual trainings (DDTP, Audit, SDPI Grant, LMIC, and Clinical) as a key venue for dissemination of information and resources for clinical staff and SDPI grantees.At present, services are being provided under a current IHS contract. A new contract needs to be in place by the current contract expiration date with staff that has the professional expertise and experience needed to immediately provide the necessary services. This will ensure absolute continuity and avoid disruption of services to the SDPI grant programs throughout the nation along with critical projects that are already underway.\nRESPONSE INFORMATION:AMERICAN INDIAN/ALASKA NATIVE, HUB ZONE SMALL BUSINESSES, 8(A) FIRMS AND SMALL BUSINESS FIRMS ARE STRONGLY ENCOURAGED TO SUBMIT CAPABILITY STATEMENTS.  THE CAPABILITLY STATEMENT MUST CLEARLY DEMONSTRATE THE FIRM'S CAPABILITY AND EXPERIENCE IN COORDINATING AND LEADING DDTP NATIONAL PROJECTS, MEETINGS, AND WORKGROUPS; COORDINATION, PROGRAMMATIC REVIEW, AND EVALATION OF AI/AN CLINICAL AND PUBLIC HEALTH PROGRAMS; TRANSLATING DIABETES RESEARCH INTO RESOURCES FOR CLINICAL PARTICE AND GRANT PROGRAMS/COMMUNITIES; DISSEMINATION OF INFORMATION AND RESOURCES; AND PROJECT MANAGEMENT EXPERTISE.INSTRUCTIONS TO INDUSTRY:Interested small business firms are highly encouraged to respond to this notice.

Mandatory Language:\nIn accordance with FAR 5.207(c)(15)(ii), All responsible sources may submit a capability statement, proposal, or quotation, which shall be considered by the agency.\nIt is anticipated that this requirement is competitive.  Non-approved sources wishing to submit a bid may do so; however; only qualified sources will be considered for award.  Government First Articles may be required from newly approved sources.  \nThis acquisition involves technology that has a military or space application.  The extent of foreign participation has not yet been determined.  Nothing in this notice contradicts other restrictions, identified in the synopsis notice or solicitation, regarding eligible sources (e.g., if this is a small business set aside, foreign sources may not participate as potential prime contractors but could, if otherwise eligible, participate as subcontractors).\nBased upon market research, the Government is not using the policies contained in Part 12, Acquisition of Commercial Items, in its solicitation for the described supplies or services. However, interested persons may identify to the contracting officer their interest and capability to satisfy the Government's requirement with a commercial item within 15 days of this notice. \nGovernment's obligation under this contract is contingent upon the availability of appropriated funds from which payment for contract purposes can be made. No legal liability on the part of the Government for any payment may arise until funds are made available to the Contracting Officer for this contract and until the Contractor receives notice of such availability, to be confirmed in writing by the Contracting Officer\nElectronic procedures will be used for this solicitation. Hardcopies of the solicitation will not be sent from this office. The solicitation will be available for download only at www.fbo.gov.\nAuthority: 10 U.S.C. 2304(c) (1), Justification: supplies (or Services) required are available from only one or a limited number of responsible source(s) and no other type of supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements.  The proposed contract action is for supplies and services for which the Government intends to solicit and negotiate with only one, or a limited number of sources under the authority of FAR 6.302.  \nThis notice of intent is not a request for competition.  However, all proposals received within 45 days (30 days if award is issued under an existing basic ordering agreement) after date of publication of this synopsis will be considered by the Government.  A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.  Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.\nIt is suggested that small business firms or others interested in subcontracting opportunities in connection with the described procurement make contract with the firms(s) listed.  \nNote:  While price will be a significant factor in the evaluation of offers, the final contract award decision may be based upon a combination of price and past performance factors as detailed in the solicitation.\nNote: An Ombudsman has been appointed to hear concerns from offerors or potential offerors during the proposal development phase of this acquisition. The purpose of the Ombudsman is not to diminish the authority of the program director or contracting officer, but to communicate contractor concerns, issues, disagreements and recommendations to the appropriate government personnel. When requested, the Ombudsman will maintain strict confidentiality as to the source of the concern. The Ombudsman does not participate in the evaluation of proposals or in the source selection process. Interested parties are invited to call the Ombudsman at (405) 734-8241. DO NOT CALL THIS NUMBER FOR SOLICITATION REQUESTS. Request for written quotation will be issued.  Only written or faxed request received directly from the requestors are acceptable. The anticipated award date will be 60 days after the issuance of this notice.\n20.

This project is the first phase of a two phase construction plan. Project A will consist of removing an existing berm along the west bank of Lolo creek, excavating existing legacy mining tailings (approximately 10,510 CY of material), grading approximately 3.6 acres of floodplain, adding floodplain roughness and planting clump plants. Grading the floodplain will require dewatering existing ponds and then filling the ponds immediately after. Ten Large Woody Debris (LWD) structures and 775 linear feet of vegetated wood and brush fascine will be installed on the stream banks and within the stream channel. In addition, trees and shrubs shall be salvaged and hauled to the project site from two different off-site government sources and used to dress the floodplain and construct the large woody debris structures and vegetated wood and brush fascine. On-site soil deposits shall be salvaged for use during the current and future project implementation and sod shall be salvaged and transplanted in the newly constructed floodplain. The contractor shall also install a temporary bridge to access the site.\nThe project site is located 60 miles from Orofino, Idaho in Clearwater County. From Orofino, follow US Highway 12 East for 7.5 miles to Jct. State Highway (SH) 11. Follow SH 11 for 28.5 miles to County Road 250 (French Mountain Rd). Turn right onto County Road 250 (French Mountain Road) and follow for 0.5 miles. Turn right onto County Road 100 (Browns Creek Road) and follow for 10.5 miles to Peterson's Corner. Turn left to continue on County Road 100 (Musselshell Rd) and follow 13 miles to project location.\nThe Government's construction estimate is between $100,000 and $250,000. A formal pre-bid tour will be held on May 18, 2015.  See Section L-11 for details. Construction work on the project shall commence no earlier than July 15, 2015; all work shall be completed by September 30, 2015. All in-stream work must take place between July 15th and September 15th (this includes installation and removal of the temporary bridge).\nSolicitation was issued on 5/8/15 with offers due 6/8/15.  Original bid bonds are required.

It is expected that a pre-proposal conference will be held. Details regarding the conference will be included in the RFP solicitation package.\nSet Aside: The proposed procurement listed herein is unrestricted per Stewardship Authority.\nThe solicitation and any resultant contract is a stewardship project in accordance with Section 8205 of Public Law 113-79, the Agricultural Act of 2014. This grants the Forest Service and the Bureau of Land Management authority to enter into stewardship contracting projects with private persons or public or private entities, by contract or by agreement, to perform services to achieve land management goals for the national forests or public lands that meet local and rural community needs. Section 8205 supersedes the authority granted to the Forest Service in section 347. This acquisition has been tailored to fit the Government's method of trading goods for services.\nObjectives for the project are generally, to define the area surrounding Thomas Bay on Petersburg Ranger District as a Stewardship Area, and specifically to minimize erosion and decrease resource damage in the Cascade Creek watershed (which drains into Thomas Bay) by improving trail conditions. This project will benefit local communities through the commercial contract offering and associated economic activity that will be generated. Long term benefits include improved trail condition to provide for improved recreational opportunities and an increase of the trail capacity, including for commercial guided services, without further degradation of the natural resources. The project is located in an area identified in the Tognass Land and Resource Management Plan (TLRMP) as having a Land Use Designation of Semi-remote Recreation and conforms to the Forest Plan direction stating activities in this LUD must \"Provide for recreation and tourism in natural-appearing settings where opportunities for solitude and self-reliance are moderate to high\".\nThis project consists of the reconstruction and re-routing of 0.5 miles of trail, reducing the current slope, and improving the tread to eliminate the amount of erosion that is occurring. Major work items are aggregate surfacing, stone riser steps, stone pitching, step stones, solid rock removal, rest areas, and demolition and replacement of the Cascade Creek bridge.\nIt is estimated that work will begin in July 2015 and be completed by July 2016. Actual start and end dates may be negotiated based upon actual award date, prospective work and weather conditions.\nSOLICITATION DETAILS: The following preliminary details are provided for the benefit of prospective offerors, but are subject to change in the actual solicitation.\nEstimated price range: between $250,000 and $500,000\nContract type: firm-fixed-price.\nSolicitation type: Request for Proposals.\nRequired bonds: Bid bond with the bid and performance and payment bonds after award of a contract.\nSite visit: An organized site visit is not contemplated; however, interested concerns are free to visit the site at any time to ascertain the nature and location of the work and general conditions which could affect the work.\nAUTOMATIC NOTIFICATION: By registering to receive notification on posted synopses, you will be automatically notified, via email, of any changes to the project. To register, select Register to Receive Notification on FedBizOpps (FBO) and follow the steps.\nINTERESTED VENDORS LIST (IVL): To register as an interested vendor, select Register as an Interested Vendor and follow the steps. Use the Register as Interested Vendor option to add your company name to the IVL and then view or print the IVL by selecting View List of Interested Vendors for each project.\nNOTE REGARDING FEDBIZOPPS LISTINGS. The FedBizOpps website has three separate listings for the Forest Service in Alaska. These are (1) R-10 Alaska Region, Juneau, AK; (2) R-10 Chugach National Forest, Anchorage, AK; and (3) R-10 Tongass National Forest, Ketchikan, AK. Prospective bidders are advised that these three listings are not purely geographic and that a requirement on either the Chugach (Anchorage) or Tongass (Ketchikan) National Forest may be posted under the Regional Office (Juneau) listing. Thus, prospective bidders seeking Forest Service opportunities in Alaska should visit both the appropriate Forest listing (Anchorage or Ketchikan) as well as the Regional listing (Juneau). The solicitation contemplated by this notice will appear under the Ketchikan listing.\nIn order to be eligible for contract award, vendors shall be registered in the System for Award Management (SAM) to include certifications and representations.

This is NOT a solicitation for proposals, proposal abstracts, or quotations. The purpose of this notice is to obtain information regarding: (1) the availability and capability of qualified small business sources; (2) whether they are small businesses; HUBZone small businesses; service-disabled, veteran-owned small businesses; 8(a) small businesses; veteran-owned small businesses; woman-owned small businesses; or small disadvantaged businesses; and (3) their size classification relative to the North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code for the proposed acquisition. Your responses to the information requested will assist the Government in determining the appropriate acquisition method, including whether a set-aside is possible. An organization that is not considered a small business under the applicable NAICS code should not submit a response to this notice.\nThis notice is issued to help determine the availability of qualified companies technically capable of meeting the Government requirement and to determine the method of acquisition.  It is not to be construed as a commitment by the Government to issue a solicitation or ultimately award a contract.  Responses will not be considered as proposals or quotes.  No award will be made as a result of this notice.  The Government will NOT be responsible for any costs incurred by the respondents to this notice.  This notice is strictly for research and information purposes only.\n1.\tBackground\nThe National Institutes of Health (NIH)/ National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke (NINDS)/ Division of Intramural Research (DIR)  is the nation's leading medical research agency whose mission is to support and conduct world-class research into the causes, treatment, and prevention of neurological disorders and stroke. The mission of NINDS is to seek fundamental knowledge about the brain and nervous system and to use that knowledge to reduce the burden of neurological disease.\nThe Protein/Peptide Sequencing (PPS) Facility, as a part of the NINDS, provides amino acid sequencing of purified proteins/peptides for NIH-wide investigators. The facility is also available for collaborations involving protein/peptide purification and more complicated sequencing strategies. To meet this aim the NINDS Protein/Peptide Sequencing Facility needs a highly sensitive mass spectrometer to precisely measure and analyze protein and peptides, small molecules and a defined set of biomarkers with high selectivity and sensitivity. The instrument will support PPS, the wider research comminuty in the NIH/NINDS, and ensure compliance with CLIA certification.\n2.\tObjective\nThe purpose of this procurement is to obtain an  Accurate Mass Time-of-Flight (TOF) Liquid Chromotography (LC) Mass Spectrometer (MS) System with an Agilent Jet Stream or equivalent system for the NIH/NINDS Protein Peptide Sequencing Facility. 3.\tScope\nThe mass spectrometer must:•\tHas a mass range of 25-20,000 m/z which is critical when measuring large intact proteins. •\tIs able to obtain up to 30 spectra/second - this is critical when coupling with the 1290 UHPLC system which has very narrow peak widths.•\tDoes not use an ion trapping design which can limit ability to detect low abundance ions in the presence of more abundant species due to space charging effects.\nCapability Statement /Information Sought.\nThe respondent's response shall also include any other specific and relevant information related to the requirements of this project that will enable the Government to determine the capabilities of the company to perform the specialized requirements described in this synopsis. Interested organizations must demonstrate and document in any response submitted, to this market survey extensive experience with and the ability to perform all of the specialized requirements elsewhere described.\nThe respondent must also provide their  DUNS number, organization name, address, point of contact, and size and type of business (e.g., 8(a), HubZone, etc.) pursuant to the applicable NAICS code and any other information that may be helpful in developing or finalizing the acquisition requirements.\nThe information submitted must be must be in an outline format that addresses each of the elements of the project requirement and in the capability statement /information sought paragraphs stated herein.  A cover page and an executive summary may be included but is not required.\nThe response is limited to fifteen (15) page limit.  The 15-page limit does not include the cover page, executive summary, or references, if requested.\nThe response must include the respondent's technical and administrative points of contact, including names, titles, addresses, telephone and fax numbers, and e-mail addresses.\nAll responses to this notice must be submitted electronically (facsimile responses are NOT accepted ) to:\nAndriani BuckContract SpecialistNIH/NIDA/SSSAAndriani.buck@nih.gov\nThe response must be received on or before June 1, 2015, 8:00 AM (EST).\nDisclaimer and Important Notes:\nThis notice does not obligate the Government to award a contract or otherwise pay for the information provided in response. The Government reserves the right to use information provided by respondents for any purpose deemed necessary and legally appropriate. Any organization responding to this notice should ensure that its response is complete and sufficiently detailed to allow the Government to determine the organization's qualifications to perform the work.\nRespondents are advised that the Government is under no obligation to acknowledge receipt of the information received or provide feedback to respondents with respect to any information submitted. After a review of the responses received, a presolicitation synopsis and solicitation may be published in Federal Business Opportunities.
